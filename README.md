## Everything About This Project/ Codes
This repository contains a custom **autoexec.cfg** for Left 4 Dead 2, fine-tuned to improve performance and stability, especially on low-end hardware.  
Tested on a laptop with an **NVIDIA MX330** GPU, this configuration reduces stutters, cleans up ragdolls faster, optimizes sound handling, and ensures a smooth experience even during intense horde attacks.

I created this config based on my own gameplay experience. I used to play Left 4 Dead 2 with FPS stuck around 20â€“30, which made the game laggy and frustrating. I searched YouTube and Google for solutions â€” some configs helped, but they didnâ€™t quite give the boost I wanted.  
So, I decided to build my own **autoexec.cfg** that automatically runs and optimizes performance for the original Steam-installed Left 4 Dead 2.

After months of trial, error, and tweaking (low graphics, high graphics, multiplayer Steam group servers), the results have been consistently better than before. Everything here is based on my own R&D experience, so if you want to use it â€” go ahead and enjoy smoother gameplay!
